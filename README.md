# MA5060_Numerical_Analysis

Code for Numerical Techniques implemented from scratch

The iterative_methods.py file has all algorithms, and can compare performance and convergence of all these methods.  
All algorithms have independent implementations also.

Algorithms Implemented - 
1. Bisection Method
2. Secant Method
3. Regula-Falsi Method
4. Newton-Raphson Method
5. Birge-Vieta Method
6. Bairstow's Method

Functions can be any algebraic combinations of polynomials Pn(x), exp(x), pi, log2(x),log10(x), acos(x),	asin(x) ,atan(x) , cos(x) ,sin(x), tan(x), acosh(x),asinh(x),atanh(x),cosh(x), sinh(x), tanh(x) ,gamma(x), lgamma(x)  

Also implemented pretty printing for all functions, so functions can be printed in their mathematical notaitonal form within the terminal.
